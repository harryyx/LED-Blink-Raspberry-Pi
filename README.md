# LED-Blink-Raspberry-Pi

This is the Python program for Blinking LED with push button using Raspberry Pi

The Raspbian operating system is used through VNC Viewer on PC.

## Usage
The LED is connected to the GPIO pins of the Raspberry Pi.

When the push button is pressed, the LED begins to glow continuously and when it is not pressed, the LED blinks at an interval of 0.7 seconds.

The current task is displayed on the terminal window. We plan to make a gui soon.
